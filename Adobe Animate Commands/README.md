# Adobe Animate Commands
These commands have only been tested on Adobe Animate 2024. However, they should still work with Adobe Flash CS.

## Installation
Copy **JSFL** files, **XML** files, or asset folder into the Adobe Animate Commands directory.

**DO NOT MOVE FILES OUT OF THEIR ASSET FOLDERS! THIS WILL BREAK THE COMMAND!**
